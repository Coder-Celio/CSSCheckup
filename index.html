    <h1>Budget dream car</h1>

    <p id ="Car">I used to love working on cars, but I stopped becuase it's a very physical job that requires special tools that are expensive and down right hard to get. So I left and started to learn how to code.</p>

        <p class="dream">This isn't just any car, I like to call it my budget dream car. It's a fun 4 cylinder car that is zippy and fun to drive around. The best part is that since it's a 4 cylinder car, It doesn't waste as much gas as a 8 cylinder vehicle does. </p>
